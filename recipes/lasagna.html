        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start The Bolognaise:</strong> Peel and finely dice the onion, carrot, celery and garlic. Fry in the olive oil over a medium heat with the bay leaves for at least 5 minutes with a lid on the pan to soften them. Add the minced meat to the sweated vegetables and break up with a spoon as it cooks over a high heat.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Finish The Bolognaise:</strong> Splash in the wine, milk, tinned tomatoes and then half fill the empty tin with water and add that too (200ml). Heat to a gentle simmer, then lower the temperature, put on a lid and cook very slowly for 3 hours, stirring occasionally and topping up with a little more water if it dries out.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cheese Sauce:</strong> Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour to form a paste. Pour in the milk, a little at a time, stirring continually and only adding more milk when the last has been incorporated and you have a smooth sauce again. Bubble very gently for 2 minutes once all the milk is in, then season well with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg and stir in all 4 types of cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Spinach:</strong> Wash the spinach, then add to a huge hot saucepan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Use tongs to keep the leaves moving until they have wilted right down. Drain into a colander and squeeze out excess water.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Courgette:</strong> Chop the courgette into a fairly small dice. Fry in a shot of olive oil in a hot frying pan with a pinch of salt and pepper to gain some good colour and soften. Toss the courgette and spinach together.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Layer:</strong> Place a layer of the meat sauce into the base of a deep ovenproof dish. Cover with fresh pasta sheets, then pour over a layer of the cheese sauce before scattering over some of the spinach and courgette mixture. Repeat with more meat, pasta, white sauce and spinach 3 more times before finishing with cheese sauce and an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the top is golden, a little crispy around the edges and piping hot throughout. Leave to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Serves 6.</li>
