        <h3>Desciption</h3>
        <p>Chewy sticky coconut rice cake also called "nian gao" in Chinese, meaning New Year cake.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 eggs</li>
            <li>500 gm glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>2 cans coconut milk (about 500 ml each)</li>
            <li>500 gm white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs and mix with sugar very well.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk and glutinous flour, and combine until very smooth.</li>
            <li>Use a 24cm x30 cm baking tray, or two smaller trays. Don’t use any trays that are too deep, it’s hard to cook through otherwise. Line a baking sheet at the bottom of the baking tray. Lightly brush or spray oil around the edges.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the baking tray, bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour. Test it with a needle. If it comes out clean, it’s done.</li>
